# Vet Clinic Tutorial Project

This project is used as the basis of a number of tutorials and exercises, as part of the *Professional Java Development and Test Automation Skills* program (see http://johnfergusonsmart.com/products). Each tutorial explores a different technique or practice essential to modern Java developers or Engineers in Test. 

This set of exercises covers Enumerations.

## Working with Enumerations

### Step 1 - Implement the tests in the `WhenWorkingWithASimpleEnumeration` class.

### Step 2 - Implement the tests in the `WhenCreatingASimpleEnum` class.

### Step 3 - Implement all the tests in the `WhenCreatingAComplexEnum` class.


## Coding Kata - a colour calculator

In traditional art, artists refer to eight main colours: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet, as well as Black and White. Red, Yellow and Blue are known as "Primary Colours". Colours that create the most contrast when placed together are known as "Opposite Colours": these are Black-White, Red-Green, Blue-Yellow and Orange-Violet. 

The coding kata will involve writing a colour enumeration that lists all of the colours mentioned above, and for any colour can provide the following methods:
  - isPrimary() - should return true if the colour is a primary, and false otherwise
  - opposite() - returns the opposite of this colour

Make sure that the code contains no if or switch statements.
  
When doing this exercise, you should work in two stages. 
  - For the first stage, complete the empty test scenarios in the order to implement the requirements.
  - For the second stage, do the same thing but by writing the test scenarios yourself.
